The offense is positioned on the right side of the field in red jerseys, facing off against the defense in white jerseys on the left side. The offense aligns in a shotgun formation with three receivers and a single back, while the defense presents a nickel package showing a single-high safety shell. Motion is detected mid-play as a receiver moves across the formation, likely to identify man versus zone coverage or to create a numbers advantage at the point of attack. Given the single-high look and the pre-snap motion, the three most likely play concepts are an inside zone RPO, a quick-game slant or flat route combination, and a deep-developing Y-cross concept. The inside zone RPO is the primary threat because the motion forces the linebackers to adjust their gaps, while the single-high safety suggests the defense is susceptible to horizontal stretches or vertical shots if they roll into Cover 1 or Cover 3.
