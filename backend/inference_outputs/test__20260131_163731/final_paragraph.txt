The offense in red is positioned on the right side of the field facing the defense in white jerseys on the left. The offense aligns in a shotgun formation with a condensed bunch set to the right and a single receiver wide left, while the defense presents an even front with a two-high safety shell. Significant pre-snap motion occurs between two and four seconds as a receiver travels across the formation, likely testing the defense's man-to-man coverage or forcing a shell rotation. Given the tight formation and the late horizontal motion, the three most likely play concepts are an inside zone run intended to exploit a light box, a mesh concept to capitalize on the rub routes created by the bunch, or a levels concept designed to high-low the linebackers. The shift in the offensive strength suggests they are looking to create a numbers advantage on the weak side or clear space for a quick underneath release against this static defensive alignment.
